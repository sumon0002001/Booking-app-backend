# Final Capstone Project's API

This is part of Microverse's final capstone project.

In this repository, I build an API with data for dragon flying instructors, classes, and user profiles based in the characters of [How to Train Your Dragon][httyd] series.

## About

The project's goal was to create a book of appointment. The back-end should be a REST API done with Ruby on Rails. The front-end should be done with React and Redux. This README will be focused on the API. For more details about the project visit the front-end's repository.

The project's assignment can be seen [here][assignment].

The front-end repository can be found [here][front-end].

Link to a live version [here][live-version].
