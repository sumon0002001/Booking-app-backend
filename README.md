# ABC Hospital - Book appointment with doctor.

> In this project, I developed backend APIs for a hospital to book an appointment with doctor. See frontend project [here](https://github.com/alishabab/appointment-booking-frontend)
> User can send a post request to signup and login.
> Logged in user is assigned a json web token for authentication/authorization.
> Only authorized users can see the doctors and book an appointment.
> Unit tests are written using RSpec and Shoulda matcher.
